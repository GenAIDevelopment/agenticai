        * As an instructor, I want to see who is enrolled in my course so that I know my audience.
        * As an administrator, I want to set prerequisites for course enrollment so that learners complete courses in a specific order.

6.  **Epic: Reporting & Analytics**
    * **Description:** Provide robust reporting and analytics capabilities for administrators and instructors to monitor user engagement, course performance, completion rates, and other key learning metrics.
    * **Potential User Stories:**
        * As an administrator, I want to generate a report of all active users so that I can track system usage.
        * As an instructor, I want to view the average quiz scores for my course so that I can assess content effectiveness.

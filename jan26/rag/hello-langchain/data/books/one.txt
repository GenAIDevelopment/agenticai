THE FOOLISH LION AND THE CLEVER RABBIT

In a vast forest near a flowing river lived a powerful lion named Mahabala. He was strong, fearless, and proud of his strength. Every day, he hunted more animals than he needed. Often, he killed not for hunger but for pleasure. Because of this, fear spread across the forest. Deer stopped grazing freely, birds flew away to distant lands, and even tigers avoided crossing his path.

The animals gathered secretly to discuss their survival. An old elephant said, “If this continues, none of us will live.” A wise fox suggested, “Let us send one animal to the lion every day as food. In return, he must promise not to hunt.”

Though afraid, the animals agreed. When the proposal was placed before Mahabala, he laughed loudly and accepted, pleased that food would come without effort.

Days passed peacefully. Each day, one animal was sent to the lion. One morning, it was the turn of a small rabbit. The rabbit was terrified but also intelligent. As he walked slowly, an idea came to his mind.

He reached the lion late. Mahabala roared angrily, “Why are you late?”

The rabbit bowed and said calmly, “Forgive me, mighty king. Another lion stopped me on the way. He claimed to be the true king of this forest and demanded your share of food.”

Mahabala’s eyes burned with rage. “Another lion? Take me to him at once!”

The rabbit led the lion to a deep well filled with clear water. He pointed inside and said, “There he is.”

Mahabala looked into the well and saw his own reflection. Thinking it was his enemy, he roared and jumped in to attack. The lion fell into the well and drowned.

The forest was free again. The animals celebrated the rabbit’s intelligence.

Moral: Intelligence can defeat even the strongest enemy.

THE UNGRATEFUL CAMEL

In a dry desert lived a jackal, a wolf, a crow, and a lion. They were friends and hunted together. One day, while wandering far from home, they met a lonely camel who had lost his way.

The lion said kindly, “You are safe with us. Stay and share our food.”

The camel gratefully agreed and lived peacefully with them. The lion hunted daily and shared food with everyone.

One unfortunate day, the lion was badly injured while fighting an elephant. He could no longer hunt. Days passed, and food became scarce. The jackal, wolf, and crow grew hungry and worried.

They whispered among themselves and said, “The camel is healthy and strong. If he dies, we can survive.”

They went to the camel and pretended to be kind. The crow said, “Friend, the lion is starving because of us. You are noble. You should offer yourself for his sake.”

The camel, foolish and trusting, believed their words. He went to the lion and said, “O king, eat me and survive.”

The lion hesitated but hunger overcame his compassion. He killed the camel.

The jackal, wolf, and crow ate happily. They laughed among themselves and said, “A fool’s goodness is his greatest weakness.”

Moral: Blind trust without wisdom leads to destruction.

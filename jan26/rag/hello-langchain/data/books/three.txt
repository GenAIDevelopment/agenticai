THE BRAHMIN AND THE MONGOOSE

In a small village lived a poor but honest brahmin with his wife and newborn son. One day, a kind neighbor gifted them a mongoose. The mongoose became part of the family and was very loyal to the child.

One afternoon, the brahmin left for work, and his wife went to fetch water, leaving the baby sleeping in the house. While she was away, a poisonous snake entered the room, crawling toward the child.

The mongoose saw the danger and attacked the snake. After a fierce fight, it killed the snake, but its mouth became stained with blood.

When the brahmin’s wife returned, she saw the mongoose with blood on its mouth. Without thinking, she assumed the worst. In anger and fear, she struck the mongoose with her water pot, killing it instantly.

Moments later, she ran inside and saw her baby sleeping peacefully and the dead snake nearby. Realizing her terrible mistake, she cried loudly in sorrow.

Her anger and haste had killed a faithful protector.

Moral: Hasty actions taken without understanding the truth lead to regret.

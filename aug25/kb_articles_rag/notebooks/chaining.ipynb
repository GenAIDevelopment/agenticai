      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Find the \"Forgot Password\" Link:** When you're on our login page (where you usually put in your email and password), look for a link that says something like:\n",
      "    *   \"Forgot Password?\"\n",
      "    *   \"Reset Password\"\n",

      "\n",
      "    *   **Example:** You'll get an email from us, maybe titled \"Password Reset Request.\" Open that email.\n",

      "\n",
      "    *   **Example:** You'll see boxes to type in your \"New Password\" and then maybe \"Confirm New Password.\" Make sure they match!\n",
      "\n",

Simply enter your new number, and follow the on-screen prompts. You might need to verify it with an OTP sent to your new number.\n",
